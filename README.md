# Image compression 

In this repo, I wrote [a basic k-means and K-means++ algorithm](https://github.com/zren15/K-means-Implementation/blob/main/kmeans.py) in python which is comparable to sklearn.cluster.KMeans package. In the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/zren15/K-means-Implementation/blob/main/kmeans.ipynb), I presented the algorithm and the output images of kmeans for image compression (reducing the total number of colors to a specific amount.)
